# Brushing up your React skills

If you are like me, then chances are good that your React skills and knowledge gets rusty if you are not constantly working with it. If not, kudos to you!

I tend to forget things a lot and therefore have to review them everytime I come back to them. This is the true essence of this project: a condensed yet comprehensive guide to get you up to date with React in the shortest amount of time. Not just the basic React syntax, but all the fluff and gruff that goes with working with React i.e. best practices, testing components, frontend build pipeline etc.  

This is designed for people who are familiar with React and fronend build tools and just need a refresher. This guide is not detailed and does not aim to be a starter tutorial.
